Generate GitHub Actions workflow YAML based on this pipeline design: {pipeline_design}.

Requirements:
- Use aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4 for AWS authentication via OIDC (OpenID Connect)
- Configure AWS credentials using role-to-assume: ${{{{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}}} and aws-region: ${{{{ vars.AWS_REGION }}}}
- DO NOT use AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - use OIDC authentication only
- Include security scanning and validation stages
- Reference secrets via secrets.* and variables via vars.*
- Add concise comments and a README-style explanation after the YAML

Return ONLY the workflow inside a ```yaml code fence followed immediately by the README text. Do not include any other prose before the YAML block.
