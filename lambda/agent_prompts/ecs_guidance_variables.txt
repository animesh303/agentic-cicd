- If ECS_CLUSTER and ECS_SERVICE are pre-configured as GitHub secrets, use:
  - ECS_CLUSTER: ${{{{ secrets.ECS_CLUSTER }}}}
  - ECS_SERVICE: ${{{{ secrets.ECS_SERVICE }}}}

- If ECS resources are created by Terraform:
  - Infrastructure job MUST run before deploy job
  - Setup Terraform CLI (with cli_config_credentials_token) BEFORE any terraform commands
  - Deploy infrastructure first, then extract ECS values from outputs
  - Deploy job must depend on infrastructure job (needs: [infrastructure])
