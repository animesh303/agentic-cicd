- If ECR_REGISTRY and ECR_REPOSITORY are pre-configured as GitHub variables, use:
  - ECR_REGISTRY: ${{{{ vars.ECR_REGISTRY }}}}
  - ECR_REPOSITORY: ${{{{ vars.ECR_REPOSITORY }}}}

- If ECR resources are created by Terraform:
  - Infrastructure job MUST run before container build job
  - Setup Terraform CLI (with cli_config_credentials_token) BEFORE any terraform commands
  - Deploy infrastructure first, then extract ECR values from outputs
  - Container job must depend on infrastructure job (needs: [infrastructure])
