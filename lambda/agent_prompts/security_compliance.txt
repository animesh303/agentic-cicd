Review this pipeline design for security and compliance: {pipeline_design}.

Use the static analyzer results below together with the pipeline design to ensure SAST, SCA, secrets scanning, and least-privilege IAM permissions.

REQUIRED SECURITY TOOLS:
The pipeline must include these security scanning tools (detailed job structures are defined in yaml_generator_ci.txt):
- SAST: Semgrep
- SCA: Trivy filesystem scanner
- Secrets Scanning: Trivy secrets scanner
- IaC Security: Trivy config scanner AND Checkov

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- All security scans MUST use `continue-on-error: true` or append `|| true` to commands so they do NOT fail the workflow
- Security scans are informational and should not block deployments
- The pipeline must use OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication with aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4 and role-to-assume (AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME secret)
- DO NOT use AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- Ensure the IAM role has least-privilege permissions
